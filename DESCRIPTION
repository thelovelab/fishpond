Description: Fishpond contains methods for differential transcript
    and gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data using inferential
    replicates for uncertainty of abundance quantification,
    as generated by Gibbs sampling or bootstrap sampling. Also the
    package contains utilities for working with Salmon and Alevin
    quantification files.
